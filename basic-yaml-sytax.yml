#There are two characters that can be used to indicate a multi-line value: | or >.


#when to Qoute:

1) if a colon ends a line or followed by a space, the values should be wrapped in double qoutes.
2) Special characters meant to be literals should be always be wrapped in double qoutes.
   YAML Special characters are: [] {} : > |
   It should ne noted that variables in ansible are an exception to the specail character rule.


#How to specify the variable

AS Anissible variables are indicated with curly braces, "{{ variable }}", They must be wrapped in double qoutes to prevent interpretation as dictinoary.


#Booleans

Bollenas are automatically converted in Ansible, thus allowing one to use yes, no, true, false, etc.

ex: become: yes

Floating point numbers are taken as number by default.
